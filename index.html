<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Subhaan Hussain, I am a Junior DevOps Engineer for Sparta global. I have recently achieved a degree in Software engineering. I have always had a passion for tech as I have studied IT in sixth form and I carried out work experience in a design consultancy called chapmanBDSP as an IT technician. Here I gained valuable skills like Team-work, communication and professionalism which are valuable skills to become a good Devops Engineer. I chose Sparta because they provide training in the most in demand tools and skills and i chose the devops course specifically because this is where my passion lies as within devops you work a lot with automation, CI/CD, testing, keeping it interesting so everyday will be different. I am also a football fanatic so in my spare i either play football or watch football and the team i support is Arsenal who are currently doing well. </p>
